            <b>Physics is science.</b> Physics is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through
            space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific
            disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Physics is technology.</b> For example, physics is behind all the different technologies in a cell phone. We
            will study how electromagnetic waves encode information between a cell phone and tower, how electricity in the
            computer chips is controlled by transistors, resistors, and other elements, how a phone's speaker produces changing
            waves of air pressure, how a phone uses GPS to know its position, and more!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Physics is engineering.</b> This class will reward a curious mind that wants to apply their knowledge of physics
            to design, build, tinker, and experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Physics is math.</b> Physics makes math less abstract and more concrete. Students will hone their math skills
            on real world problems giving their math skills a greater relevance and fluidity.</p>

        <h1 class='underlined'>About Me</h1>
        <p>I graduated from University of Georgia with a B.S. in physics and astronomy. After college I moved to Los Angeles
            and got credentialed to teach high school physics and chemistry. I’ve been teaching physics, chemistry, and computer
            programming in California since 2006. Before joining New West I was both the dean of students and chemistry teacher
            at SLO Classical Academy.</p>
        <p>I nerd out on: books, hiking, soccer, science, coding</p>
