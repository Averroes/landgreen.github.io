		<h2 class='underlined'>Electric Current</h2>
		<p>Current is a measurement of the flow of electric charge over a period of time.</p>
		<div class='definition'>
			<h1>$$I = \frac{q}{\Delta t}$$</h1>
			<strong>I</strong> = electric current [A, Amps, Amperes]
			<br><strong>q</strong> = charge that passes a point on a wire [C]
			<br><strong>Δt</strong> = a period of time [s]
		</div>
		<p>The direction of current is defined as the direction of positive charge flow. Electrons actually move in the opposite direction.</p>

		<div class='example'>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> Two wires of cross-sectional area 1.6mm² connect the terminals of a battery to the circuitry in a clock.  During the time interval of 0.04s, 5.0 x 10<sup>14</sup> electrons move to the right through the cross section.  What is the magnitude and direction of the current?</p>
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$q = 5.0 \times 10^{14} e^{-} \left(\frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19}C}{1 e^{-}}\right)$$
				$$q = 0.00008C$$
				<br>
				$$I = \frac{q}{\Delta t}$$
				$$I = \frac{0.00008}{0.04}$$
				$$I = 0.002 A $$
				<p>If the electrons move to the right the current is to the <strong>left</strong>.</p>

			</details>
		</div>
		<div class='example'>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> If 0.320 mA of current flow through a calculator,  how many electrons pass through per second?</p>
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$ I = \frac{q}{\Delta t}$$
				$$ q = I\Delta t$$
				$$ q = (0.320 \times 10^{-3})(1)$$
				$$ q = 0.000320 \ C \ \left(\frac{electron}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}C}\right) = $$
				$$ q = 2 \times 10^{15} \ electrons$$

		<h2 class='underlined'>How fast is electric current?</h2>
		<p>Electric current can be thought of as the average motion of a huge number of electrons through a wire.  As the electrons travel they don't just move in a straight line.  They drift through the wire in a random walk as they bounce off other electrons and towards protons. Statistically more electrons will flow forward than backwards.</p>

		<p>The speed of electrons in a typical wire is around 0.0002 m/s. If the speed of electrons in is so slow how can we explain the near instantaneous effect of electricity?</p>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Voltage</h2>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Ohm's Law</h2>
		<div class='definition'>
			<h1>$$ V = IR$$</h1>
			<strong>V</strong> = voltage, a change in electric potential [v, volts]
			<br><strong>I</strong> = electric current [A, Amps, Amperes]
			<br><strong>R</strong> = resistance [Ω]

		<details class='history'>
			<summary>Gustav Kirchhoff</summary>
			<br>
			<div>Gustav Kirchhoff was the physicist that is given the credit for creating the “Kirchhoff’s Law.” He was born on May 12, 1824 in Konigsberg, Prussia (now Russia). This law is an extension of Ohm’s Law and generalized the equations regarding current flow
				and adapted them in the case of electrical conductors in three dimensions. Eventually, Kirchhoff found that current flows through a conductor at the speed of light. These laws are extremely important in understanding how an electric circuit functions.

				<br>
				<br>

				<li>Kirchhoff also contributed to the study of spectroscopy and was a major contributor to the advancement in the research of blackbody radiation.

					<li>Kirchhoff also founded the spectrum analysis with chemist Robert Bunsen

						<li>“Kirchhoff’s Law” was initially called “Laws of Closed Electric Circuits”, but was later named after the creator.

							<li>Kirchhoff was first a “Privatdozent”, which is an unpaid lecturer at the University of Berlin. But he eventually got a position at the University of Heidelberg as the professor of Physics.
