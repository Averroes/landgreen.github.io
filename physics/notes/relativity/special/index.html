			Speed and velocity have no meaning without a reference point. If I said we are moving at 230,000 m/s, your first question
			should be relative to what. A plane? The Earth? The Sun? We are moving at 230,000 m/s relative to the center of our galaxy,
			the Milky Way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the choice of reference point is arbitrary, it makes sense that physics works the same at any relative speed. Physics
			works the same moving at 0 m/s relative to our galaxy as it does moving at 230,000 m/s.
		</p>

		<div class="definition">
			Relative velocity is the velocity with which a object approaches or recedes from another object
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> Imagine two cars. One is moving at 15 m/s and the other at 20 m/s. How fast are they moving relative
			to each other?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$v = 20\tfrac{m}{s}-15\tfrac{m}{s}$$ $$v = 5 \tfrac{m}{s}$$
			</details>
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> Image a boat traveling up a river. The current in the river is 5 m/s downstream. The boat is moving
			upstream at 15 m/s relative to the water in the river. How fast is the boat moving relative to the land?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$v = 15\tfrac{m}{s}-5\tfrac{m}{s}$$ $$v = 10 \tfrac{m}{s}$$
			</details>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Speed of Light</h2>
		<p>In 1676
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light">Ole Rømer</a> discovered that light has a speed by timing the eclipses of the Jupiter moon Io. He found the speed to be
			around 220,000,000 m/s. This isn't too far from the value we use today.
		</p>
		<div class="definition">
			<h1>$$ c = 3 \times 10^8 \tfrac{m}{s} $$</h1>
			<p>In 1887 the
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qJoRNseyLQ">Michelson–Morley experiment</a> proved that the speed of light is constant even for observers moving at different speeds!</p>
		</div>

		<p>A constant speed of light for all observers, leads to a paradox. Imagine I am at rest relative to you, and I shine my flashlight
			at you. You will measure the speed of light to be 3 x 10⁸ m/s. Now imagine I am moving towards you at a high speed and
			I shine my flash light at you. The light will still move at 3 x 10⁸ m/s, no faster.</p>

		<p>How can two observers moving relative to each other both see the speed of light as the same?
		</p>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Special Relativity</h2>
		<p>In 1905 Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, a modification of the laws of physics to take into account a constant
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo">speed of light</a>. Special relativity says that observers may measure different values for distance and time, but they
			agree about the speed of light.
		</p>

		<p> Postulates of special relativity
			<br>
			<br>1. The laws of physics are the same in all reference frames.
			<br>2. Light moves at the same speed for all observers.

			<p>
				<strong>inertial reference frame</strong> = A point of view with no acceleration.</p>
			<p>Special relativity impacts us in several ways. Some examples are:
				<li>the physics of magnets</li>
				<li>the color of gold</li>
				<li>the mass of electrons in an atom</li>
				<li>Global Positioning System (GPS)</li>

				<a href="https://www.lucify.com/inside-einsteins-head/">explorable explanation</a>.</p>


			<h2 class='underlined'>Lorentz transformations</h2>
			<p>Lorentz transformations convert between two inertial reference frames. We will use gamma in the equation below for each
				conversion.
			</p>
			<p>A high relative velocity will cause observers to disagree about concepts like the passage of time, the lengths of objects
				and the mass of objects. You can see a rough
				<a href="http://codepen.io/lilgreenland/full/EKpjxq">simulation</a> of these dilation effects.</p>

			<div class="definition">
				<h1>$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$</h1>
				\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
				<br>
				<em>Gamma is always greater than 1.</em>
				<br>\(v\) = relative velocity [m/s]
				<br>\(c\) = speed of light, 3 x 10⁸ [m/s]
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Calculate gamma for two reference frames at

					$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{0^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}}$$
					$$\gamma = 1$$

			<p>At zero velocity, the effects of special relativity aren't noticeable becomes gamma becomes one. As the relative speed

			<h2 class='underlined'>Time Dilation</h2>
			<div class="definition">
				<h1>$$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$</h1>
				\(\Delta t_0\) = proper time for observer, as seen from a frame of reference where the events occur in the
				<strong>same</strong> location
				<br>
				<br>\(\Delta t\) = elapsed time for observer, as seen from a frame of reference where the events occur in
				<strong>different</strong> locations
				<br>
				<br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
			</div>
			<p>\(\Delta t_0\) is how long events take when at rest relative to the events. This is the point of view where there is no
				relative velocity between events and observer.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are flying in an airplane, the events on the plane occur in the same location, because there is no relative motion.
			</p>

			<p>\(\Delta t\) is how much time passes for the observer while watching events that are moving. This is the point of view
				where there is a relative velocity between events and observer.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you watch an airplane fly past, events on the plane occur in different locations because the airplane is moving.
			</p>

			<p>Because gamma must be greater than one, \(\Delta t\) will always be larger than \(\Delta t_0\). An observer will see moving
				frames of reference in slow time.</p>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> You are on Earth, and a spaceship zooms past near the speed of light. Will you see the ship in slow
				motion or fast forward?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					<br>You will see them in slow motion. Observers always see moving objects in slow motion.
				</details>
				<br>What does the spaceship see?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					<br>From the ship's point of view you are in slow motion!
				</details>
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Your watch says it’s been a day. How much time do you see pass for an object moving at 0.999c relative
				to you?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = 3$$
					<br> $$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 $$ $$ 1 \ day = 22.3 \Delta t_0 $$ $$ 0.045 \ days = \Delta t_0 $$
				</details>
			</div>



			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> If 30 seconds pass for an observer on Earth how much time do they see pass for a spaceship moving at
				0.9c?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = 2.7$$
					<br> $$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 $$ $$ 30 = 2.7 \Delta t_0 $$ $$ 11.1 s = \Delta t_0 $$
				</details>
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> An observer on Earth can see a clock on a spaceship moving at 0.85c. How much time will the Earth observer
				experience while they see 30 seconds pass on the ship?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$\gamma = 2.55$$
					<br> $$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 $$ $$ \Delta t = (2.55) (30) $$ $$ \Delta t = 76.5s $$
				</details>

			<div class='example'>
				<p>
					<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/muon.html">Muons</a> are elementary particles similar to electrons, but more massive. Muons are produced in Earth's upper atmosphere
					by cosmic rays, but they have a half life of 2.2 microseconds. This means after 0.0000022s half of a population of muons
					will have decayed in other particles. </p>
				<p></p>
				<strong>Example:</strong> As muons enter the Earth's atmosphere they typically have speed of 0.98c. How long would the half life
				of these high speed muons look to an observer at rest relative to the muon?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$\gamma = 5.0$$
					<br>$$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 $$ $$ \Delta t = (5) (2.2 \times 10^{-6}) $$ $$ \Delta t = 11 \times 10^{-6} s$$ $$

			<h2 class='underlined'>Length Contraction</h2>
			<div class="definition">
				<h1>$$ L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$</h1>
				\( L\) = contracted length, as seen from a relative velocity
				<br>\( L_0\) = rest length, as seen from its own rest frame

				<br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
			</div>
			<p>The rest length is always longer. An object will look contracted from a moving reference frame. The contraction only occurs
				in the direction fo the relative velocity.</p>


			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> When you are holding a meter stick it looks like it 1 meter long. How long would the meter stick look
				if it was moving at 0.5c relative to you?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$\gamma = 1.15$$
					<br> $$L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$ $$ L = \frac{1}{1.15} $$ $$ 0.87 m = L $$
				</details>
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> I see myself as 1.84m tall. If I ran past you at 0.4c how tall would I look to you?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					<br> I would still look 1.84m tall because the length contraction is in the direction you are traveling. I would look thinner
					though!
				</details>
			</div>

			<h2 class='underlined'>Relativistic Mass</h2>

			<div class="definition">
				<h1>$$ m = \gamma m_0 $$ </h1>
				<br>\( m \) = mass, as seen by an observer with a relative velocity
				<br>\( m_0\) = rest mass, as seen by an observer at rest
				<br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
			</div>
			<p>The rest mass is
				<strong>lower</strong> than the mass seen in motion. The observed mass increases as the relative velocity increases.</p>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> My rest mass is 77kg. What would an observer at relative velocity of 0.94c measure mass as?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$\gamma = 2.93$$
					<br> $$ m = \gamma m_0 $$ $$ m = (2.93)(77) $$ $$ m = 225.6kg $$
				</details>
			</div>

			<h2 class='underlined'>Mass and Energy</h2>
			<p>Energy has many forms. Mass is just another type of potential energy.</p>
			<div class="definition">
				<h1>$$ E = mc^2$$ </h1>
				\( E\) = Energy [J]
				<br>\( m \) = relativistic mass, as seen by an observer with a relative velocity [kg]
				<br>\(c\) = speed of light, 3 x 10⁸ [m/s]
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> How much energy would an observer measure for a 1kg mass at rest?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$ E = mc^2 $$ $$ E = (1)(3 \times 10^{8})^2 $$ $$ E = 9 \times 10 ^{16} J$$ For perspective the energy from the nuclear
					bomb dropped on Hiroshima was 6.3 x 10¹³ J. A 1kg of matter has about 1000 times more energy from its mass.

			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> How much energy would an observer measure for a proton at rest?
				<details>
					<summary>solution</summary>
					$$ m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} kg $$

			<h2 class='underlined'>Gravitational Time Dilation</h2>
			<p>
				A unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of
				spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present.

				Consequences: Gravitational Time Dilation Frequency Shift Light Deflection Gravitational lensing Gravitational waves Singularities

			</p>

			<div class="definition">
				<h1>$$ \Delta t_0 = \Delta t_f \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) } $$ </h1>
				\(\Delta t_0\) = slow-ticking time for an observer inside the gravitational field at distance r from the center of the mass
				[s]
				<br>\(\Delta t_f\) = fast-ticking time for an observer outside the influence of the gravitational field [s]
				<br>\(G\) = 6.67408 × 10

			</div>

			<h2 class='underlined'>Black Holes</h2>
			<p>
				Heavy masses can push gravitational time dilation to the point of breaking because you have to take the square root of a
				negative number. We can find where the equation breaks down by solving for the radius where the time dilation approaches
				zero.$$ \Delta t_0 = \Delta t_f \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) } $$ $$\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right)
				} = 0 $$ $$1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) = 0 $$ $$1 = \frac{2GM}{rc^2} $$ $$r = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$
				<p>This radius is called the Schwarzschild radius, or the event horizon.</p>
				<p>Objects that achieve the high density needed to reach this point are called black holes. We can only speculate how black
					holes might behave. The equation suggests very extreme outcomes. At the event horizon time stops. Objects fall into
					black holes and never get out, frozen in time.
				</p>
			</p>

			<div class='example'>
				<strong>Example:</strong> At the center of the milky way (our galaxy) there is a black hole with the mass of 4.3 million solar
				masses. Find the radius of its event horizon. $$ M_{sun} = 2 \times 10^{30} kg $$

				<details>
