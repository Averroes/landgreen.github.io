			Speed and velocity have no meaning without something to reference. If I said we are moving at 230,000 m/s, your first question
			should be relative to what. A plane? The Earth? The Sun?
		</p>
		<p>
			We are moving at 230,000 m/s relative to our galaxy, the Milky Way.
		</p>

		<div class="definition">
			Velocity must be relative to a reference frame. A
			<strong>reference frame</strong> is a point of view from which events are observed.
		</div>
		<p>A person on a train is at rest from the reference frame of an observer on that train. An observer at the train station
			will see the same person as moving.
		</p>
		<p>Each observer only sees motion in others. They see themselves at rest.

		<h2 class='underlined'>Speed of Light</h2>
		<p>In 1676
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light">Ole Rømer</a> discovered that light has a speed by timing the eclipses of the Jupiter moon Io. He found the speed to be
			around 220,000,000 m/s. This isn't too far from the value we use today.
		</p>
		<p>We know the speed of light is 3 x 10⁸ m/s, but what is that speed relative to?</p>
		<div class="definition">
			<h1>$$ c = 3 \times 10^8 \tfrac{m}{s} $$</h1>
			<p>In 1887 the
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qJoRNseyLQ">Michelson–Morley experiment</a> proved that the speed of light is constant even for observers moving at different speeds.</p>
		</div>
		<p>It seems like a constant speed of light for all observers leads to a paradox.</p>

		<p>How can two observers moving relative to each other both see the speed of light as the same?
		</p>
		<ul class="listing">
			<li>An observer on a 20 m/s train shines a light forward measures the speed as 3 x 10⁸ m/s.</li>
			<li>An observer on the ground also sees the light from the train as 3 x 10⁸ m/s.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>How can they both see the speed of light as the same? Shouldn't one of the observers see the speed of light as 3 x 10⁸
			m/s + 20 m/s?</p>
		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Question:</strong> How would the train experiment work if the observers were measuring the speed of sound?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				<br>Sound has a constant speed, but only when at rest relative to the air.
				<ul class="listing">
					<li>An observer on a 20 m/s train yells out a window on the train and measures the speed as 343 m/s - 20 m/s. They measure
						sound as slower.
						<br>
						<br>(or faster depending on what direction the sound is moving)</li>
					<li>An observer at the train station measure the speed of the sound as 343 m/s.</li>
				</ul>

			</details>
		</div>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Special Relativity</h2>
		<p>
			The Michelson–Morley experiment and a few other experiments indicated that there was a problem with our understanding of
			relative velocity.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1905 Albert Einstein published his answer to the problem of relative velocity. Einstein suggested special relativity as
			a modification of the laws of physics to take into account a constant speed of light. Special relativity suggests that
			space and time change for different observers in a way that keeps the speed of light constant.
		</p>

		<p> Special relativity is based on two postulates:
			<br> 1. The laws of physics are the same in all reference frames.
			<br> 2. Light moves at the same speed for all observers.
			<p>
				<a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/">Special relativity</a> predicted that observers moving at a relative velocity to each other don't agree on the:
				<li>order of events</li>
				<li>passage of time</li>
				<li>length of objects</li>
				<li>mass of objects</li>
			</p>

			<p>Because of the high speeds needed, special relativity is difficult to observe. So far all
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_special_relativity">tests</a> support the theory to a high degree of precision.</p>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Lorentz factor</h2>
		<p>We will use the
			<strong>Lorentz factor</strong> in equations that convert between two inertial reference frames for concepts like time, length,
			and mass. The Lorentz factor represents the scale of difference between each point of view.
		</p>

		<div class="definition">
			<h1>$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$</h1>
			\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
			<br>\(v\) = relative velocity [m/s]
			<br>\(c\) = speed of light, 3 x 10⁸ [m/s]
		</div>
		<p>Gamma is always greater than 1, but it grows towards infinity as the relative velocity approaches the speed of light.</p>
		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> Calculate gamma for two reference frames at rest relative to each other.
			<br>
			<strong>v = 0</strong>
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{0^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}}$$
				$$\gamma = 1$$ When the relative velocity is low there is very little time dilation. This explains why the effect isn't
				noticeable in everyday situations.
			</details>
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> Calculate gamma for two reference frames moving at half the speed of light relative to each other.
			<br>
			<strong>v = 0.5c</strong>
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.5)^2 c^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.25}}$$
				$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}}$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{0.866}$$ $$\gamma = 1.155$$
			</details>
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> Calculate gamma for two reference frames moving at the speed of light relative to each other.
			<br>
			<strong>v = c</strong>
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{c^2} } }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-1}
				}$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0} }$$ $$\gamma = \frac{1}{0}$$ $$\gamma = undefined $$ As the relative velocity approaches
				the speed of light, extreme effects like: time dilation, mass increase, and length contraction hinder acceleration. This
				means that the speed of light is also the maximum relative speed for any object.
			</details>
		</div>
		<p>At a low relative velocity, the effects of special relativity aren't noticeable because gamma becomes one. As the relative
			speed approaches the speed of light, gamma increases towards infinity.</p>
		<div id="graphGamma"></div>
		<h2 class='underlined'>Time Dilation</h2>
		<div class="definition">
			<h1>$$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$$</h1>
			\(\Delta t_0\) = proper time for observer, as seen from a frame of reference where the events occur in the
			<strong>same</strong> location
			<br>
			<br>\(\Delta t\) = elapsed time for observer, as seen from a frame of reference where the events occur in
			<strong>different</strong> locations
			<br>
			<br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
		</div>
		<p>\(\Delta t_0\) is how long events take when at rest relative to the events. This is the point of view where there is no
			relative velocity between events and observer.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are flying in an airplane, the events on the plane occur in the same location, because there is no relative motion.
		</p>

		<p>\(\Delta t\) is how much time passes for the observer while watching events that are moving. This is the point of view
			where there is a relative velocity between events and observer.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you watch an airplane fly past, events on the plane occur in different locations because the airplane is moving.
		</p>

		<p>Because gamma must be greater than one, \(\Delta t\) will always be larger than \(\Delta t_0\). An observer will see moving
			frames of reference in slow time.</p>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Question:</strong> You are on Earth, and a spaceship zooms past near the speed of light. Will you see the ship in slow

			<br>What does the spaceship see?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				<br>From the ship's point of view you are in slow motion!
			</details>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> You see a person on a spaceship moving at 0.999c. While you watch the person, you see 2 seconds pass

				<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/muon.html">Muons</a> are elementary particles similar to electrons, but more massive. Muons are produced in Earth's upper atmosphere

				will have decayed in other particles. </p>
			<p></p>
			<strong>Example:</strong> As muons enter the Earth's atmosphere they typically have speed of 0.98c. How long would the half life

		<h2 class='underlined'>Length Contraction</h2>
		<div class="definition">

			\( L\) = contracted length, as seen from a relative velocity
			<br>\( L_0\) = rest length, as seen from its own rest frame

			<br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
		</div>
		<p>The rest length is always longer. An object will look contracted from a moving reference frame. The contraction only occurs

		<h2 class='underlined'>General relativity</h2>

		<p>Special relativity is limited to only situations where observers aren't accelerating. General relativity, published by
			Einstein in 1915, extended relativity to acceleration, and specifically gravitational acceleration.</p>

		<p>
			General relativity proposed a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. Space
			and time are curved by mass/energy.
		</p>

		<p> Some of the consequences of general relativity are:
			<li>Gravitational Time Dilation: high gravity slows time</li>
			<li>Gravitational lensing: light bends around massive objects</li>
			<li>Singularities: high mass density leads to infinite density (black hole)</li>
			<li>Gravity waves: fast moving masses make waves</li>
		</p>
		<h2 class='underlined'>Gravitational Time Dilation</h2>
		<p>General relativity correctly predicted that gravity slows down time.</p>
		<p> This effect is less complex than special relativity time dilation, because both observers agree on who is slow. The deeper
			in the gravity well the slower time runs.
		</p>

		<div class="definition">
			<h1>$$ \Delta t_0 = \Delta t_f \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) } $$ </h1>
			\(\Delta t_0\) = slow-ticking time for an observer inside the gravitational field at distance r from the center of the mass
			[s]
			<br>\(\Delta t_f\) = fast-ticking time for an observer outside the influence of the gravitational field [s]
			<br>\(G\) = 6.67408 × 10
			<sup>-11</sup> = universal gravitation constant [N m²/kg²]
			<br>\(M\) = mass of gravity well [kg, kilograms]
			<br>\(r\) = distance to the center of the mass [m, meters]
			<br>\(c\) = speed of light, 3 x 10⁸ [m/s]
		</div>

		<h2 class='underlined'>Black Holes</h2>
		<p>
			Heavy masses can push gravitational time dilation to the point of breaking because you have to take the square root of a
			negative number. We can find where the equation breaks down by solving for the radius where the time dilation approaches
			zero.$$ \Delta t_0 = \Delta t_f \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) } $$ $$\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right)
			} = 0 $$ $$1 - \left( \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) = 0 $$ $$1 = \frac{2GM}{rc^2} $$ $$r = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$
			<p>This radius is called the Schwarzschild radius, or the event horizon.</p>
			<p>Objects that achieve the high density needed to reach this point are called black holes. We can only speculate how black
				holes might behave. The equation suggests very extreme outcomes. At the event horizon time stops. Objects fall into black
				holes and never get out, frozen in time.
			</p>
		</p>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Example:</strong> At the center of the milky way (our galaxy) there is a black hole with the mass of 4.3 million solar
			masses. Find the radius of its event horizon. $$ M_{sun} = 2 \times 10^{30} kg $$
