The Origin of Kirchhoff’s Law:

Gustav Kirchhoff was the physicist that is given the credit for creating the

“Kirchhoff’s Law.” He was born on May 12, 1824 in Konigsberg, Prussia (now

Russia). This law is an extension of Ohm’s Law and generalized the equations

regarding current flow and adapted them in the case of electrical conductors in

three dimensions. Eventually, Kirchhoff found that current flows through a

conductor at the speed of light. These laws are extremely important in

understanding how an electric circuit functions.

Interesting Facts:

 Kirchhoff also contributed to the study of spectroscopy and was a major

contributor to the advancement in the research of blackbody radiation.

 Kirchhoff also founded the spectrum analysis with chemist Robert Bunsen

 “Kirchhoff’s Law” was initially called “Laws of Closed Electric Circuits”, but

was later named after the creator.

 Kirchhoff was first a “Privatdozent”, which is an unpaid lecturer at the

University of Berlin. But he eventually got a position at the University of

Heidelberg as the professor of Physics.
